# Crow
A gui Edition of the OSINT tool blackbird.

To install simply clone [blackbirds repo](https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird.git) from here you may install crow by [cloning it](https://github.com/Nthompson096/crow)

The GUI tool mainly uses the functionalities of blackbird; so you'd need to clone blackbird first and either download or clone crow and it's requirements_GUI.txt

Before you attempt to install; you'll need to move the crow files (excluding the readme) into the root of the backbird directory, from there you can do the following.
    
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    pip install -r requirements_GUI.txt
